# Covid-19-Preprocessed-Dataset
Latest Covid-19 Dataset

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) time series listing confirmed cases, reported deaths and reported recoveries. Data is disaggregated by country (and sometimes subregion). Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the [Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)][sars2] and has had a worldwide effect. On March 11 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic, pointing to the over 118,000 cases of the coronavirus illness in over 110 countries and territories around the world at the time.

This dataset includes time series data tracking the number of people affected by COVID-19 worldwide, including:

* confirmed tested cases of Coronavirus infection
* the number of people who have reportedly died while sick with Coronavirus
* the number of people who have reportedly recovered from it

# Sample Code

# fill NA
df['Province/State'] = df['Province/State'].fillna("")
# grouping by date
confirmed = df.groupby('Date').sum()['Confirmed'].reset_index()

# See your first plot
fig = go.Figure()
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x = confirmed['Date'], y = confirmed['Confirmed'], mode = 'lines+markers', name = 'Confirmed', line = dict(color = "Orange", width = 2)))
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x = recovered['Date'], y = recovered['Recovered'], mode = 'lines+markers', name = 'Recovered', line = dict(color = "Green", width = 2)))

### Note
Hi,
Recently, some of the countries have stopped reporting Covid data and it is also found discrepancies in data if taken from multiple sources. Data reported till July 2020 is quite accurate so we will only explore from Jan 2020 to July 2020.

Ref.

https://covidtracking.com/about-data/faq#why-have-you-stopped-reporting-national-recoveries

https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues/3464

https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues

1. Active Cases are calculated based on recoveries so this will not be also correct
2. Anything that requires recoveries in the calculation isn't 100% correct, like deaths/100recoveries, etc.

Here is some article to understand it

https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2020/05/19/why-arent-coronavirus-recoveries-always-reported/

https://abc11.com/nc-coronavirus-recovery-cases-update/6127051/



Most of these reports are based on the US but mostly it is true for the rest of the world.
