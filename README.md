# COVID19-Data-Analysis
  I have done a data analytics project on the COVID-19 situation which covers data of all the confirmed cases, recovered cases, death cases. The data is visualized with the help of plotly(which helps to create very beautiful graphs/plots) and folium(for the map visulization purpose) dependencies. I have also analyzed the comparison between COVID-19 diseases with other epidemics.

Below are the graphs which are used in this project:
- Area Plot
- Folium Map
- Choropleth Map
- Bar Plots
- Line Plot
- Scatter Plot
- Tree Map
